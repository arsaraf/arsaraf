    "\n",
    "Ans. A String is a sequence of one or more characters (including letters, numbers and symbols) that can be either a constant or a variable. Strings are immutable sequences, meaning they are unchanging. It is a type of information that would be store in variable.\n",
    "Ex. “hello” is a string containing a sequence of characters ‘h’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’, ‘o’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are symbols that can use to store data in program.  Numbers, String, List, Tuple are the types of variable.\n",

    "2) Float – No. with decimal point 2.3, 4.9\n",
